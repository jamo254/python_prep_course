7. **List Operations**: Create a list of five fruits and print the first and last fruit.
8. **Tuple Creation**: Create a tuple with five numbers and print it.
9. **Dictionary Usage**: Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs and print it.
10. **String Length**: Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints its length.

### Control Structures
11. **Even or Odd**: Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
12. **Grade Calculator**: Create a program that assigns grades based on user input scores.
13. **Simple Calculator**: Implement a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers based on user choice.
14. **Count Down Timer**: Write a countdown timer using a for loop.
15. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
16. **Prime Number Check**: Create a program that checks if a number is prime.
17. **Factorial Calculation**: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
18. **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Calculate the sum of natural numbers up to n using a loop.
19. **Palindrome Check**: Check if a given string is a palindrome.
20. **Find Maximum in List**: Write a function that returns the maximum number from a list.

## Intermediate Level

### Functions and Modules
21. **Count Vowels**: Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a string.
22. **Reverse String**: Create a function to reverse a given string.
23. **List Comprehension**: Use list comprehension to create a list of squares from 1 to 10.
24. **Generate Random Numbers**: Generate five random numbers between 1 and 100.
25. **File I/O**: Write data to a text file and read it back into the program.
26. **Sort List**: Write a function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order without using built-in functions.
27. **Merge Dictionaries**: Merge two dictionaries into one.
28. **Count Words in String**: Write a function that counts the number of words in a string.
29. **Check Anagram**: Create a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
30. **Find Duplicates in List**: Write a function to find duplicate elements in a list.

### Object-Oriented Programming
31. **Create Class**: Define a class `Dog` with attributes like name and age, and methods like bark().
32. **Inheritance Example**: Create two classes where one class inherits from another (e.g., `Animal` and `Dog`).
33. **Class Method vs Instance Method**: Demonstrate the difference between class methods and instance methods in Python classes.
34. **Static Methods in Class**: Define static methods within your class and call them without creating an instance.
35. **Encapsulation Example**: Show how to use encapsulation by making attributes private in your class.
36. **Polymorphism Example**: Demonstrate polymorphism by overriding methods in derived classes.
37. **Class with Properties**: Use properties to manage access to private attributes in your class.
38. **Class with Class Variables**: Create class variables that are shared among all instances of the class.
39. **Magic Methods Example**: Implement magic methods like `__str__` or `__repr__` in your class for better string representation.
40. **Composition Example**: Show composition by creating classes that use instances of other classes as attributes.

## Advanced Level
